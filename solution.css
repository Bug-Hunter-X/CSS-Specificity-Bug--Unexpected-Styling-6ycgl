Several solutions address this specificity issue.  Here are two:

**Solution 1: Using more specific class selectors**

Instead of relying on an ID selector for one paragraph, apply classes and use more specific selectors.  This makes the CSS more maintainable and avoids specificity conflicts:

```css
.paragraph {
  color: blue;
}

.important {
  color: red;
}

<p class="paragraph">This paragraph is blue.</p>
<p class="paragraph important">This paragraph is red.</p>
```

**Solution 2:  Important! (Use Sparingly)**

Use the `!important` flag as a last resort to override other styles. This is generally not recommended because it makes CSS harder to maintain and reason about:

```css
p {
  color: blue;
}

#myParagraph {
  color: red !important;
}

<p>This paragraph is blue.</p>
<p id="myParagraph">This paragraph is red.</p>
```

The recommended approach is to utilize well-structured class selectors to avoid conflicts.
